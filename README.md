## Model-View-Control

- The (non-graphical) __model__ part of the program deals with storing, maintaining or manipulating the data.
- The graphical __view__ part displays the data and provides the components for user interaction.
- The (again non-graphical) __control__ part ensures that the user actions result in the desired responses by the program. The control part is the bridge between the model and view parts.
